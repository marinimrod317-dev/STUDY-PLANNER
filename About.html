    <h1>About us</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our study planner application. We are dedicated to helping students organize their study schedules and improve their academic performance.</p>

   <p>Helping You Study Smarter, Not Longer
At STUDY PLANNER, we believe that academic success isn't about cramming harder — it's about planning smarter. Our mission is to give students the tools they need to stay organized, reduce stress, and achieve their goals with confidence.
We know what it's like to juggle assignments, exams, deadlines, extracurriculars, and personal life — all at once. That is why we created a study planner designed to simplify your schedule, clarify your priorities, and help you stay consistent every day.
Our Mission</p>


<p>To empower students with a simple, effective, and motivating planning system that turns overwhelming workloads into manageable action steps.
Why We Built This

Too many students struggle not because they lack ability, but because they lack structure. We saw the need for:
•	A clean, distraction-free planning experience
•	Smart scheduling tools that adapt to real student life
•	Goal tracking that keeps motivation high

•	A system that supports productivity without burnout
So we built a platform that helps you:
✔ Organize assignments and exams
✔ Break big goals into smaller tasks
✔ Track study sessions and progress
✔ Build consistent study habits
✔ Stay motivated and accountable
</p>
